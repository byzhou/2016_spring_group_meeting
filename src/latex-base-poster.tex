                \begin{itemize}
                    \item [*] CMOS integrated circuits (ICs) become
                    critical in both defense and municipal support systems.
                    %\item [*] The IC industry has a trend towards international
                    %co-operation and away from vertical integration,
                    %which requires the security of ICs.
                    %\item [*] During the various phases of the IC integration,
                    %the ICs face threats from Hardware Trojans (HTs), IP privacy
                    %and IC counterfeiting. 
                    \item [*] HTs are one of the most significant problems in
                    hardware security. Since HTs can modify the functionality of
                    ICs, leak secret information, disable the entire chip, HTs
                    are the security breaching point of hardware security.
                    \item [*] There are three kinds of HT insertions, malicious
                    IP core insertion, design modification and layout
                    modification. The first two can be detected during the
                    functional testing phase of IC production.
                    \item [*] The layout HT insertion, however, can be extremely
                    small in terms of area and power consumption, which is very
                    hard to be detected during the post-silicon
                    verification.~\cite{rostami2014primer} 
                    %\item [*] Thus, there is a pressing need for rapid, accurate
                    %and robust detection for this kind of HT insertion.
                    \item [*] This work is proposing an optical method that can
                    detect malicious tampering and insertion of HTs at the
                    fabrication stage.
                \end{itemize}

            \posterbox{Related work}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item [*] State-of-the-art techniques for detecting HTs
                    include both destructive and non-destructive
                    approaches.~\cite{Tehranipoor2010,Karri2010}
                    %\item [*] Destructive approaches requires high cost of
                    %reverse engineering and precise measurements. 
                    \item [*] Non-destructive approaches are taken the
                    form of functional testing or side-channel
                    analysis.~\cite{Chakraborty2009}
                    %\item [*] Functional testing consists of system inputs and
                    %verification on the outputs. However, for some HTs,
                    %triggering rate is extremely small. These test can be costly
                    %and time consuming.
                    \item [*] Side-channel analysis detect the HTs by analyzing
                    the physical characteristics of the chip. Such techniques
                    include power analysis, time-based analysis, emission
                    analysis, and thermal analysis.~\cite{Rad2008Iccad,
                    Alkabani2009Iccad,Potkonjak2009Dac, Sheng2012Tvlsi}
                    %\item [*] One of the most popular techniques is PUF design.
                    %With certain amount of challenge and response (CRP)  pairs
                    %of the design, the PUF can be used as the signature of the
                    %chip.~\cite{wei2012hardware}  
                    \item [*] These designs can be easily implemented but
                    requires a large amount of CRPs to have a complete coverage
                    of the measurement space.

                In this work, we propose the near-IR backside imaging for the
                IC. The difference of near-IR imaging reflectance between
                functional and engineered fill cells are significantly different.

                %resolution imaging we expect it to scale well with the move to

                %At the same time, it also scales well to measuring large areas
                %since we rely on low resolution imaging. This enables
                %measurements over a large field of view and therefore a large
                %number of gates can be imaged simultaneously.

            \posterbox{Detection Process}
                During the detection phase, the IC has been backside imaged with
                near-IR light. Fill cells show much more reflectance than the
                functional cells.

            \begin{itemize}
            \item [*] We propose a new technique that uses backside imaging for
            detecting HTs. 
            \item [*] We evaluate our proposed approach using a variety of AES and
            PIC blocks and show that we are able to detect extremely small HTs,
            which have power consumption that is 12 less than 2\% of the total
            chip and an area that is less than 0.1\% of the total area.
            \item [*] We also prove that our approach is robust to measurement noise
            and $\pm10\%$ process variations.
